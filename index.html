    <p> We as people have assigned plenty of tasks that were traditionally carried out by humans to robots already. This entails countless jobs, such as many areas in retail. But why stop there?

        <br>
        <br>
        So we thought, why not digitize the art of singing? Yamaha has done it. With Vocaloid<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, they've popularized the concept of virtual singers. But we want to go a step further. With our software, we aim to make voice synthesization available to the general public.

        <br>

        Introducing: <strong> SynthX</strong>, the ultimate solution to anyone's crippling inability to sing.
        <br>
        With two amazing voicebanks available, you too can now create stunning vocal tracks for your songs with surprising ease. Don't like them? Make your own! With the Standard Edition, you can create and customize your own voicebanks to your own liking. The possibilities are endless!
